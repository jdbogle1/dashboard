# Exercise 0

1. Stop the resized column causing siblings to disappear out of view and becoming irretrievable.
2. Add a cursor resize to the whole RHS of the div, not just the bottom right.

# Exercise 1

1. Make sure that the 3rd pane actually does occupy the remainder of the container
Hint: 2 ways you can achieve this
2. Make it possible to resize each vertical pane, by dragging the divider to its right.
Hint: We are trying to avoid using the bottom right corner of the pane itself

Hint: Do not be afraid to restructure your markup to achieve these results.
Hint: Don't forget that your markup does not always correspond structurally to what people see e.g. Should you turn your dividers into thick borders? Careful of the consequences and implications.

# Exercise 2

3. Now make it possible to add any number of vertical (columns) panes inside your horizontal panes.
4. Test that your very first pane can be a horizontal (rows) pane or more, with then vertical ones inside.

# Exercise 3

5. Make all panes load by default with an equal split of the space in their container.
